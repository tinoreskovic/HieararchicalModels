$\textbf{18.3.}$

Where the outcome variable is the gain score:


$$y_i - x_i = \alpha + \theta z_i +\beta x_i + \epsilon_i$$

so: $$\qquad y_i = \alpha + x_i + \theta z_i +\beta x_i + \epsilon_i$$

And the only difference between the gain score model and the original model with the post-tretment measure as the outcome variable:

$$y_i = \alpha + \theta z_i +\beta x_i + \epsilon_i $$

is that the estimated constant term will be different, so the $\hat{\theta}$ will not be different.

An even simpler explanation is that adding a constant term to a function only shifts its graph vertically by the value of the term.
